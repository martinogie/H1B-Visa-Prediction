This project aimed to predict the approval or denial of H1B visa applications using machine learning models, specifically logistic regression and random forest regression. 
The dataset included historical H1B visa application data, featuring attributes such as employer details, job title, salary, work location, and applicant qualifications. 
The goal was to build predictive models that could classify applications as approved or denied based on these features.
Logistic Regression was applied to model the binary classification problem (approval vs. denial), providing a probabilistic approach to predict outcomes based on input features.
Random Forest Regression was employed to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data and improve prediction accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees and providing most important features.
The models were trained and tested on a portion of the dataset, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The project aimed to offer insights into factors influencing the approval process and create a model that could assist employers and applicants in making informed decisions regarding H1B visa applications.
